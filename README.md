     *    as an empty square (black border, transparent bg color)

    // Challenge: use a ternary to determine the backgroundColor.
    // If darkMode is true, set it to dark
    // If darkMode is false, set it to light

/\*\*
_ Challenge part 2:
_ 1. Create a separate component called "Box" and
_ replace the `div` above with our <Box /> components
_ 2. Pass the Box component a prop called `on` with the
_ value of the same name from the `boxes` objects
_ 3. In the Box component, apply dynamic styles to determine
_ the backgroundColor of the box. If it's `on`, set the
_ backgroundColor to "#222222". If off, set it to "none"
